# [DEPRECATED] ES6+ in Cloud Functions for Firebase

This example is deprecated in favour of [ES6+ in Cloud Functions 2](https://medium.com/@jthegedus/es6-in-cloud-functions-for-firebase-2-415d15205468) and it's folder in my [blog-examples](https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-gcp-examples) repo.

Use ES6+ to develop Cloud Functions for Firebase today!

Here is the accompanying [Medium post](https://medium.com/@jthegedus/es6-in-cloud-functions-for-firebase-959b35e31cb0).

## TLDR;

Develop your Coud Functions in a different directory to the default `./functions` directory. I suggest `./functionsES6`. Then use `babel-cli`, `babel-preset-es2015` and `rimraf` with some npm scripts to transpile to ES2015 into the default `./functions` directory on deploy (`yarn deploy`).

* Cloud Functions [package.json](https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-functions-es6-example/blob/master/functionsES6/package.json)
* Cloud Functions [index.js](https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-functions-es6-example/blob/master/functionsES6/index.js)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-functions-es6-example
cd firebase-functions-es6-example
yarn install
```

## Deploy to Firebase

```
yarn deploy
```

N.B.: You will need to connect the project to your Firebase project. Edit the name in [.firebaserc](https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-functions-es6-example/blob/master/.firebaserc)

## A note on Code Compatibility

Everything was tested on Ubuntu 17.04. If you wish for Windows native support please [submit an issue](https://github.com/jthegedus/firebase-functions-es6-example/issues/new) so we can work on a Windows branch. Please report any macOS errors as I do not have access to a device to test. [My development environment can be found here](https://github.com/jthegedus/dotfiles).
